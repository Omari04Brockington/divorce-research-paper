## Abstract
This study examines the long-term wealth trajectories of people who have divorced. Divorce is a life transition with general economic repercussions, frequently entailing long-term ramifications for earning capacity and wealth accumulation. Although it impacts all parties, the post-divorce economic lives of men and women are polar opposites, with institutional gender disparities in levels of income recovery and access to wealth-accumulating prospects. The current study examines the effect of divorce on long-term economic outcomes with a particular focus on comparing income change and asset building among divorced men and women. The research attempts to unravel the mediating processes underlying gender-specific disparities through detailed examinations of the contributions of educational advancement, child care arrangements, re-marriage, and spousal support receipt using the National Longitude Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Introduction
Divorce is a life-changing event with emotional and financial consequences—reshaping an individual’s financial trajectories and influencing long-term economic stability. The aftermath of divorce can impact income, wealth accumulation, and financial security, posing strenuous challenges that extend beyond personal finances to broader social implications, such as economic inequality and increased welfare dependency. 

In the modern age, there’s this misconception that women are the primary beneficiaries of divorce. It is believed that women always win custody of the children and receive tremendously high alimony and child support. This is just a myth, both parties have their financial standing obstructed, and women bear a higher economic burden in the aftermath as found by Thomas J. Espenshade, an American sociologist, known for his research in family dynamics. Further research implies that divorced women often face a steeper decline in income and longer recovery periods in wealth accumulation in comparison to their male counterparts. I want to conduct an in-depth analysis of the divorce-related economic impacts between genders. 

Prior studies have already identified the economic disparity between men and women in divorce outcomes, but gaps remain in understanding which specific factors contribute to these differences. For instance, a limited number of sources examine how factors such as custody arrangements, alimony, and remarriage distinctly impact financial recovery for men and women. Investigating these gaps is essential for developing policies and financial strategies that support more equitable outcomes for both parties post-divorce.
